# -Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator-APC-
This project implements an Arbitrary Precision Calculator capable of performing mathematical operations on extremely large numbers or numbers requiring high precision. It overcomes the limitations of standard data types by using custom algorithms and data structures to handle numbers of arbitrary size and precision.
